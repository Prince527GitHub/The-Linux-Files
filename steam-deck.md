### Coding
I personnally install nodejs and python on my systems.

#### Nodejs
For nodejs I install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [PNPM](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm).
So just follow the guides on their githubs.

Then just use NVM to manage nodejs.
```sh
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

#### Python
For python I install [PyENV](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

Then just use PyENV to manage python.
